What does it do ?
-----------------

The program is a trivial web-application which awaits for incoming
upload on a given endpoint URL. 
When uploads come, they are saved in a temp directory to be
asynchronously processed by an other server configured via IoC


Download and test
-----------------

You will need to have a JVM installed, at least 1.5, and recent Maven 2 version.

Clone the repos:
% git clone git@github.com:fanf/scala-spring3-upload.git

Compile and launch the server:
% mvn clean jetty:run

Test:
% curl url -F MyFile.txt=@/path/to/the/file/to/upload http://localhost:8080/upload/
